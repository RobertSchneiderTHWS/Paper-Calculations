# Enhancing Information Security Literacy:<br>The Impact of Framing Across Non-Technical Trainees ðŸ“„

Welcome to the repository of the custom Python script used in the study "Enhancing Information Security Literacy: The Impact of Framing Across Non-Technical Trainees". 
This script was developed as a key component of my research to quantitatively assess the impact of framing on information security awareness among non-technical trainees.

The script provides a robust, transparent, and reproducible method for computing key statistical measures, ensuring the precision and reliability of my study's findings. 
It's designed to handle an array of statistical computations crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of both positively and negatively framed learning materials in enhancing security awareness.

## Statistical Measures ðŸ“Š

### Standard Deviation:
Computes the standard deviation for both positively and negatively framed groups, shedding light on the variability in participants' responses and their engagement with the security material.

### Shapiro-Wilk Test:
Conducts the Shapiro-Wilk test to evaluate the normality of the data distribution. This step is crucial as it informs the choice of the most appropriate statistical tests for further analysis and interpretation.

### Independent Samples T-Test:
Performs an independent samples T-test to compare the mean scores of the two distinct framing groups. This analysis is key to determining the statistical significance of any observed differences.

### Effect Size (Cohen's d):
Calculates Cohen's d to measure the effect size, thereby providing a clear indication of the magnitude of the difference between the two groups.

### Confidence Interval for Mean Difference:
Computes the 95% confidence interval for the mean difference, offering a range that likely encloses the true mean difference, enhancing the understanding of the results' precision and reliability.
